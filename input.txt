With the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, the residents of J&K will not hold dual citizenship and will be treated just like the other citizens of India.
Now that the citizenship clause is not applicable, it effectively removes all the added privileges and causes for discrimination that was related to the title.
One of the most important boons was that the non-J&K residents couldn't buy land within the state.
Thus, those individuals, living in J&K have ample resources that were not utilised by them to possess a secure home.
The worst sufferers during this equation were women, who lost rights to their land if they married a person outside the state.
Moreover, even her children weren't entitled to inherit the land.
On the contrary, a Kashmiri man was liberated to marry any woman hailing from any state and retain the rights on his land.
A non-J&K resident was neither allowed to participate in state legislative elections nor was he allowed to contest.
The non-J&K residents couldn't take admission in professional courses for post-graduation since state universities in Jammu and Kashmir demand a Permanent Resident Certificate (PRC).
Moreover, they were not entitled to any aids or scholarships by the government to use during a government job, a permanent residency is required so that wasnâ€™t possible which has been rectified now.
Any laws enacted by the Parliament weren't automatically made applicable to the state.
Hence, backward communities within the state, including the SCs and STs weren't granted the advantages which the Indian Constitution otherwise gives them.
Even rights like Right to Education and Right to Information   applicable within the state.
More so than this, the middle had no power to declare a financial emergency within the state but all of it is gone for good now, Kashmir enjoys the same rule and regulation as the other states in the country.
